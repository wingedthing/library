# library
A small browser library app that allows a user to add and buy books utilizing google books api.  
   
As of now it utilizes browser localStorage to store book information but I plan to integrate google Firebase as the backend database in a later update.  
     
Built for the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library) - Full Stack JavaScript course.
